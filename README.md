# SQL_credit_card_transactions_analysis
## Evidence to suggest that a credit card has been hacked:
Hackers may use a card to make small, frequent charges in order to avoid detection. These charges may be for items that are relatively inexpensive, such as coffee or gas. Also hackers may sometimes make small test transactions to check if the card is active and valid before attempting larger charges. I would say it is suspicious if the count of transactions (that are less than $2.00 per cardholder) is higher than 10, in those cases it can be evidence that card has been hacked. Thereby based on our data I would highlight below cardholders as potentially been hacked, where is the 1st column is ID, 2nd - Name, 3rd - Count of he transactions that are less than $2.00:
12	"Megan Price"	26
24	"Stephanie Dalton"	22
19	"Peter Mckay"	22
11	"Brandon Pineda"	21
10	"Matthew Gutierrez"	20
13	"John Martin"	19
18	"Malik Carlson"	19
16	"Crystal Clark"	19
20	"Kevin Spencer"	18
7	"Sean Taylor"	18
25	"Nancy Contreras"	16
4	"Danielle Green"	16
23	"Mark Lewis"	16
8	"Michael Floyd"	15
5	"Sara Cooper"	14
15	"Kyle Tucker"	12
2	"Shane Shaffer"	11

## Top 100 highest transactions made between 7:00 am and 9:00 am
where is the 1st column is ID, 2nd - date/time, 3rd - amount. The highest amount is 1,894.00 and the lower is 11.65. High-Value Purchase between 7am and 9am might be suspicious, since it's not a typical time for shopping. Most people do their shopping during the day, so a high-value purchase during the early morning hours is out of the ordinary. Also hackers might try to exploit early morning hours when people are less likely to be monitoring their accounts or when customer service is less available to address potential issues. I would say that all transaction higher than 100$ can be evidence that card has been hacked.
